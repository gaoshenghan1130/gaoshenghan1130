## Project Lists

### Robotics & Embedded Systems

**[RoboCup SSL Team - SJTU SRC (2023-2024)](https://github.com/sjtu-src/Falcon2023)<a id ="src2023"></a>**

**Role:** Software Team Leader ‚Äì overseeing full software architecture and integration
- Determine software architecture and module division
- Decide on orientation of softw
- Lead final code review and debugging  
- Ensure system reliability and maintainability

**Task Stack**: C++, Python, Lua, Qt, Google Protobuf, OOP, Data Structures & Algorithms, Git, Unit Testing, Multithreading, Network Programming, UDP, CMake

A comprehensive overhaul of the software architecture for the RoboCup Small Size League team at SJTU, featuring recursive skill structures and two levels of FSM (Finite State Machine). Key contributions include:

- **UDP Python Server** for using Python libraries in a C++ codebase:<a id="udp_server"></a>
    - Multiprocessing architecture to handle client connections across threads and overcome GIL limitations for maximum performance
    - Asynchronous I/O for Python module communication (using `asyncio`)
    - RRCC (Request‚ÄìResponse‚ÄìConfirm‚ÄìConfirmContinue) protocol for reliable communication; see [PyModule Protobuf Definition and RRCC](./PyModule/PYM_Protobuf&RRCC_Eng.md) (original Chinese version [here](./PyModule/PYM_Protobuf&RRCC.md))
    - Qt signal-slot wrapper for asynchronous communication on the C++ side
    - QThread wrapper for singleton thread pool management with direct return values from thread calls using hashed name-mapping, protected by mutex
    - Unit testing for each module to ensure reliability and correctness

- **Best Advancer Matcher Algorithm**:<a id="matcher_algo"></a>
    - Accounts for dynamic positions of robots and the ball
    - Solves a quartic equation (fourth-degree polynomial) using Ferrari's method in O(1) time complexity for best advancer selection
    - Achieved a 20% improvement in successful pass rate based on past failure logs

- **Chip Location Prediction with a Single Camera**:<a id="chip_pred"></a>
    - Kalman filter for ball state estimation and prediction
    - Parabolic trajectory approximation using the least squares method (utilizing the Python server module above)
    - ¬±0.3 m accuracy in chip location prediction near the field boundaries; less accurate directly under the camera due to limited information, but sufficient for most field positions


**[RoboCup SSL Team - SJTU SRC (2025)](https://github.com/sjtu-src/Falcon2026)**

**Role:** Software Team Leader (same as [above](#src2023))

**Task Stack**: Python, CMake, Qt, Pybind11, OOP, Unit Testing, Finite State Machine, Data Structures & Algorithms


A next-generation software architecture for the RoboCup Small Size League team at SJTU, designed to enhance motion control, **REPLACEING LUA WITH PYTHON**, and improve overall system robustness. Key contributions include:


- **Portation from Linux to Windows-Linux Cross Platform** (Not using WSL, but rewriting CMakeLists.txt and codebase for Windows compatibility) <a id="portationL2W"></a>
  - Reconfigure some of third party libraries for Windows compatibility and modern CMake usage and toolchains, listing in my respository including a old versiono of [ODE](https://github.com/gaoshenghan1130/ODE_modernRepair) (later found better version in vcpkg),  and [vartypes](https://github.com/gaoshenghan1130/VarTypes_Robocup) (provided by the [Robocup Official](https://www.robocup.org) without a Windowsos version).
  - Rewrite CMakeLists.txt in all modules, create a top-level CMakeLists.txt to manage all submodules, enable compilation either with each module or all-in-one.
  - Optimize cmake sturcture, create function automatically to recursively add all source files in a directory to target, avoiding manual adding. Shortening code size each module from 200-400 lines to less than 100 lines.
  - Refactor config-time generation of protobuf, lua and python bindings to compile time generation, monitoring changes in proto/lua/py files and auto-regenerate corresponding cpp/h files.

- **Python Based FSM (Finite State Machine)** for better modularity and maintainability: <a id="pyfsm"></a>
    - Each skill is represented as a state in the FSM, allowing for clear transitions and encapsulation of behavior
    - Simplifies the addition of new skills and modification of existing ones without affecting the overall system

- **Modular Motion Test System Framework** for new member D* Argorithm training and testing <a id="modularMotionTest"></a>
    - Modular design allows for easy integration of new motion algorithms and testing scenarios
    - Provides a controlled environment for algorithm development and performance evaluation
  - CRTP(Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) based design for compile-time polymorphism, reducing runtime overhead, maintaining shorter and more readable code
  - Debug Engine based Vim-like UI for real-time parameter tuning and visualization
  - Unit Testing for motion algorithms to ensure reliability and correctness


### Some project may be on private repo



- [Odyssey - Time Travel Game](https://focs.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/git/SilverFOCS-24su/p2team07), *Require SJTU account to access*
A time travel game developed using Elm, a functional programming language for front-end web development. The game features a unique time travel mechanic that allows players to accelerate or slow down time to solve puzzles and navigate through levels.
